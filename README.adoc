= Monads for developers

This repo contains the demo code for my session about monads and why they are useful for developers, not only
mathematicians. The idea of the demo is how to write an expression parser with very expressive error handling
the easy way.

== Structure

There are two subfolders here, which implement the same parser

- Kotlin as a main stream language using the popular FP companion library, https://arrow-kt.io[Arrow-Kt]
- Haskell as a nice, but rather niche language using its innate powers
